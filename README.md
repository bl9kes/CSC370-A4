GNG Event Management Database

Overview
This project is a database-backed application designed to manage and display event-related information for a fictional organization called GNG. The project includes a fully structured PostgreSQL database schema and a custom feature that showcases upcoming events through a terminal-based calendar display.

The project is structured in multiple phases, with Phase 5 introducing a date preprocessing and event calendar display feature in Python, allowing users to view all events scheduled for the current year.

Contents
gng_dump.sql – SQL dump file for creating and populating the PostgreSQL database.
PHASE5.md – Documentation and Python code for the event calendar feature.
README.md – Project overview and usage instructions.

Future Improvements
Add support for time zones and time of day.
Enable editing and deleting events from the command line.
Integrate with a web front-end for visual display.
